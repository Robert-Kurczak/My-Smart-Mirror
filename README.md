# My Smart Mirror
My very first hardware related project. It's a mirror that displays text on its surface.

## General info
The mirror is a monitor in a wooden frame with a phoenician mirror on top of it. The monitor is controlled by minicomputer - Raspberry Pi 3.
It displays:
* Date and time
* News
* Weather forecast in my area
* Calendar events that can be synchronised with various devices

## Technologies
1. [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) library
2. [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648)
3. [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
4. [AirQuality](https://github.com/CFenner/MMM-AirQuality)

#### Due to the large amount of personal information I had to put in configuration files I won't be sharing them.
