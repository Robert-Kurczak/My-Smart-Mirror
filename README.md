# MagicMirror
My very first hardware related project. It's a mirror that displays text on its surface.

## General info
The mirror is a monitor in a wooden frame with a phoenician mirror on top of it. The monitor is controlled by minicomputer - Raspberry Pi 3.
It displays:
* Date and time
* News
* Weather forecast in my area
* Calendar events that can be synchronised with various devices
